CAB BOOKING PROBLEM
Problem Statement
We want to build a cab booking platform to allow a rider to book a cab.
Details:

1. The location is represented as a (x, y) coordinate.
2. Distance between two points (x1, y1) and(x2, y2) is sqrt((x1-x2)^2 + (y1-y2)^2)
3. Platform has decided upon maximum distance a driver has to travel to pickup a rider.
4. A cab has only 1 driver.
5. Sharing of cab is not allowed between riders
6. There is a single type of cab
   Please build an application that exposes following features to riders and drivers.
7. Register a rider.
8. Register a driver/cab
9. Update a cab's location
10. A driver can switch on/off his availability
11. A rider can book a cab
12. Fetch history of all rides taken by a rider.
13. End the Trip

Expectation from this round

1. Demonstrable code is first expectation. To do this, you can choose any interface you
   are comfortable with - CLI, WebApp, MobileApp, APIs or even simply run the code
   via Tests or a main method.
2. Code should be extensible.
3. Clean professional level code.
4. Functional Completeness including good modelling.
5. User Identification but not authentication.
6. Backend Database is optional. However modelling should be complete.

TO INSTALL AND RUN APP

1. npm install
2. nodemon app.js
